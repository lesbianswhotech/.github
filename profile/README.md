# LWT
LWT is a community of women, women of color, and non-binary leaders in and around tech (and the people who support them).


## Our goals

### To be more visible to each other
We all know that familiar moment when we meet someone in a professional setting and sense a shared experience, but don't quite know how to bring it up. We're here to make those connections easier by bringing together women, women of color, and non-binary technologists to build a strong network of colleagues and friends across the industry.

### To be more visible to others
We need more examples of women, women of color, and non-binary leaders. That means we need to come on stage as the amazing, successful people we are.

### To get more women, women of color, and non-binary people in technology
Right now, women are some of the most gifted people in technology. Yet, there are far fewer of them than there should be: Women account for 1 in 5 people in STEM fields. Because there aren’t enough women, women of color, and non-binary people in tech, they are rarely quoted as experts by the mainstream media and blogs, serve on panels, and serve in high positions at top tech companies.

### To connect our community to other organizations and companies that are doing incredible work
There are so many groups and startups fighting for our rights, and they need our support. LWT provides a platform to raise awareness of their work, connecting these organizations to women, women of color, non-binary people, and tech leaders.
