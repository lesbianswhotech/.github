# Lesbians Who Tech &amp; Allies üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
Lesbians Who Tech &amp; Allies is a community of LGBTQ women, non-binary and trans individuals in and around tech (and the people who support them).


## Our goals

### To be more visible to each other
We all know that familiar feeling of meeting someone in a work setting, knowing they‚Äôre queer, and trying to work it into a conversation. We‚Äôre about making that happen by connecting queer women, non-binary, and trans techies, and by building a network of colleagues and friends in the industry.

### To be more visible to others
We need more examples of queer, female, trans, GNC, and POC leaders. That means we need to come on stage as the amazing, successful people we are.

### To get more women, POC, and queer and trans people in technology
Right now, women are some of the most gifted folks in technology. Yet there are far fewer of than there should be: Women account for 1 in 5 people in STEM fields. (That stat is even lower for queer women.) Because there aren‚Äôt enough women, trans, and GNC people in tech, they are rarely quoted as experts by the mainstream media and blogs, serve on panels, and serve in high positions at top tech companies.

### To connect our community to other organizations and companies that are doing incredible work
There are so many groups and startups that are fighting for our rights, and they need our support. Lesbians Who Tech & Allies provides a platform to raise awareness of their work, connecting these organizations to queer women, and non-binary and trans people in tech.
